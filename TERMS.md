# Terms of Use for Proprietary Binaries

This project contains two types of components:

## 1. Open-Source Code (MIT License)  
All source code in this repository — including the command-line interface (CLI), orchestration scripts, and supporting utilities — is licensed under the MIT License. You are free to use, modify, and distribute this code for personal **or** commercial purposes.

## 2. Proprietary Binaries (NPU Kernels)  
The binary components — including the AMD NPU-accelerated kernels — are **NOT open source** and are **protected by pending patents**. These binaries are provided under the following terms:

- ✅ **Free Use (Non-Commercial & Low-Revenue Commercial Use)**: You may use the binaries free of charge for non-commercial, academic, or personal use. You may also use them commercially **if your company’s annual revenue remains at or below USD 10 million**.  
- 🚫 **Commercial Use Beyond Threshold**: If your company’s annual revenue exceeds USD 10 million, you must obtain an explicit commercial license to continue using the binaries in a commercial setting.

## Licensing  
To obtain a commercial license (once you exceed the threshold or wish to negotiate a commercial arrangement), please contact:  
📧 **info@fastflowlm.com**

Unauthorized commercial use, including use beyond the revenue threshold without a license, may violate patent laws and is strictly prohibited.

## Notes  
- If you wish to run your own model using FastFlowLM, we offer kernel optimization and integration services for commercial deployment.
