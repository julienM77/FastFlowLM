    title: "Modular layouts + Markdown content"
    body: |
      The docs site uses the `docs` layout plus shared components (hero blocks, feature lists, pill lists).
      Everything inherits the same typography and navigation as the landing pages.
    cards:
      - label: "Layouts"
        title: "`_layouts/docs.html`"
        body: |
          Wraps content with the shared header/footer and a sticky sidebar generated from `site.docs_nav`.
      - label: "Includes"
        title: "`_includes/sections/*`"
        body: |
          Reusable sections for heroes, model teasers, CTA bars, and more.
      - label: "Styling"
        title: "`assets/styles.css`"
        body: |
          Dark theme shared by every page, with component classes for sections, grids, and docs content.

  - type: two_column

      kicker: "Contribute"
      title: "Docs are just Markdown files"
      body: |
        Edit anything in `/docs`, add front matter (`layout: docs`) and open a PR.
        Liquid shortcodes + markdown tables keep everything portable.
